Localization
====================================

**_warning_**: this is all highly experimental. don't rely on it just yet.

## Express

First, load up the module:

```coffeescript
i18n = require 'jqtpl-express-i18n'
```

then in your `app.configure` call:

```coffeescript
app.configure ->
  app.use blah blah
  # ...
  
  i18n.enable app
  
```

you can _optionally_ pass some _options_ to it:

```coffeescript
app.configure ->

  # these are the defaults
  i18n.enable app, 
    default: 'en'
    path: '/lang'
    tag: 'e'
  
```

## Templates

This module defines a new `{{e}}` tag for jqtpl, that you should use like this:

````html
<p>{{e "String to be translated"}}</p>
<ul>
  <li>{{e "Erinaceous"}}</li>
  <li>{{e "Inaniloquent"}}</li>
  <li>{{e "Limerance"}}</li>
  <li>{{e "Nihilarian"}}</li>
  <li>{{e "Gibberish"}}</li>
</ul>
```

You can change "e" to anything you want. I think it looks nice. Just avoid overwriting the existent template tags (=, html, etc).

## Language files

By default, language files live in the `/lang` folder. You can change that using the options. I recommend you name your files `language.js` or `language.coffee` where `language` is the 2 character language code to keep it organized.

They should export an object where the keys are the original strings, and values are the translated ones.

A sample language file:

```javascript
exports.pt = {
# Last updated: Fri Apr 29 2011 17:03:53 GMT-0300 (BRT)
# chat.html
	  "like"          : "like"
  , "next"          : "próximo"
# dashboard.html
  , "Likes"         : ""
  , "History"       : "Histórico"
  , "Nothing here." : "Nada pra ver aqui."
# index.html
  , "Email"         : ""
  , "Password"      : "Senha"
  , "show password" : "exibir senha"
}
```

This example was generated by the `pullstring` tool that's included in the package. More info below.

You can also export multiple languages from a single file and name it anything you want. In fact, any .`js` or `.coffee` file will be read.

```coffeescript
exports.es =
	"Gibberish"  : "Algarabía"
	"Depone"     : "Deponer"
	
exports.ru =
  "Gibberish"  : "Тарабарщина"
	"Depone"     : "Давать показания под присягой" # really??
	
exports.jp
  "bacon"      : " ベーコン"
  "eggs"       : "卵"
  
```

## Extracting strings

Now _that's_ easy. This module installs a command line tool called `pullstrings` that will parse your view files and pluck all of your strings into a nicely formatted output.

Usage is `pullstrings path_to_views [output file]`

For example, if you're in the root dir of your app and keep your views into `/views`, just run
    pullstrings views

It will print all the collected strings, filenames and a time stamp.

If you want to save it to a file, .i.e. `lang/strings.txt`:
    pullstrings views lang/strings.txt

You can then copy that to your language folder and carry on making your app available to the whole world.
